## Monarch Catalog Prototype

I was asked to build an HTML prototype for home & detail pages, from a provided design. It was for a new online catalog and the devs wanted to see styles and responsive use before building it in Angular. They decided to use Material UI componenets, so I used Material.io (mdc) to get the ball rolling.

## Monarch Microsite

Here is the microsite I built alongside the catalog prototype from provided designs. Marketing wanted an easy access CMS so I chose WordPress. Later, I updated CTA buttons with Free Trial email forms to forward to an onboarding site.

EDIT: This microsite and catalog are retired since we switched to Shopify,

    "overview": "\r\\n## Old Portfolio Site\r\\n\r\\nI ran my [old portfolio site](https://nextjs-brett-snyder.vercel.app/) for many years. Customized a Nextjs Tailwind UI template that has been solid. Minimal, dark mode, markdown content, and clean design. No complaints. It may have been all I needed, but I was ready for a change.\r\\n\r\\n## My Vision\r\\n\r\\nBuild from scratch, using the latest version of NextJs and React. Scary since they were just released, so bugs. Since I am the sole stakeholder on this project, lets push it. \r\\n\r\\nI thought about using the font awesome icon set, and went with the clean Lucide set instead. I wanted a more fleshed out portfolio and a easy to use markdown blog as before. Instead of the standard flat black and white dark mode, I wanted a glassmorphism look. Dark and light irradecent with some glass/transparent effects.\r\\n\r\\nOverall, my site needed more impact. The normal portfolio look has a small circular avatar, not enough impact for desktop. I do not want a large picture staring at me on load. My compromise was Homepage loads clean with subtle animated orbs and clean text. Then large portrait background on hover.\r\\n\r\\nOnly show two large hero buttons and hide the rest of the main navigation into a side menu and footer. I also am running this on on Vercel's free Tier so I do not want any resume or commercial aspects showing. I neded to add a config to hide all commercial elements until I am ready to upgrade.\r\\n\r\\nBelow the hero, keep my old latest blog and recent work timeline. Links to Github and Linkedin. I did like my old site flow, so will add an About and Tools page with more breakouts than before. Add a proper blog and projects listing page with thumbnails. And actually have Project case studies this time. My hope was to share the engine for blog and projects. \r\\n\r\\nDid not want to deal with form bots so for contact, is just be an email link as before.\r\\n\r\\n## Look and Feel\r\\n\r\\nFor layout, I could have created a Figma, But I already knew I was building sections close to my old site, so jumped in with just the homepage, test out some concepts. I really liked the dark iridescent look using my feathered orbs over the hero image. That gave me the soft color shift I wanted. The hover portrait on desktop was a bit scary at first, but pushed opacity and a slower hover it was impactful - not always looming.\r\\n\r\\nThe glass look was intriguing to me, yet it could feel busy real fast. I added a very slow floating background panel that accentuated the transparency. Overall the hover effects to soft and subtle. I initially went glassy buttons, but ended accentuating them more. \r\\n\r\\n## The Build\r\\n\r\\n1. **Homepage:** After my concept phase with working look and feel, I added nav and footer components to layout. Header is sticky glass. I liked the glass blur there but felt it too distracting with the content panels, mainly used rgba. Added placeholder latest blog cards and fine-tuned the hover effects. They will be pulled in dynamically later. Timeline added a splash of color, but mostly mapped static content. \r\\n\r\\n   Here I had to face issues from running the latest version of Next.js and React bugs. Service worker, cache, and Edge browser, and latest Tailwind had bugs galore. I almost gave in and went back to old stable versions. But I knew they will depreciate soon, so stuck with it. I had to remove Tailwind and created my own utilities classes. I admit, my framework versions were released a couple weeks ago, so was not surprised. Edit: Realized Vercel Edge CDN makes my Service Worker layer redundant, so I removed it. Network shows improvement.\r\\n\r\\n2. **About Page:** Since the homepage was done, I followed that approach, but did not want all the animated orbs on my background, so created a configurable background component depending on page it is used. Mostly went with one top left orb with motion, the rest static. Then replaced my Homepage background with that background component.\r\\n\r\\n   I added a few stats and achievements. Better than the verbose About message I had before. Content more geared to conversions and takeaways. Added glass effects, not as boring as before.\r\\n\r\\n   This is also where I dialed in the light and dark mode styles. I tried to create several themes, but narrowed it down to two I liked best. I left some of the old test styles, in case I want to revisit. \r\\n\r\\n3. **Tools:** This was my old Uses page. I did not want to limit it to just a long list, so I added a 4 tab tile approach. Pulled category icons from a massive array and gave myself plenty of room to grow. \r\\n\r\\n4. **Projects and Blogs:** This took trial and error to figure what worked with using the latest frameworks. The markdown approach used in my old site used did not work here despite trying many different angles. My dilemma was I wanted the ease of adding markdown content for blogs and projects, yet missing that fast load I had in other JSON based sites like Shopify. How to combine that without killing my api resources for the free Vercel Tier?\r\\n  \r\\n   The solution ended being close to what I hoped for. Not everything, but close. For creating a project or blog add a specific folder like my-cool-project in the corresponding content folder. Then add some images in that specific folder. Run an npm script to generate a base markdown file and JSON file to your new project folder. \r\\n   \r\\n   Then easily save content to the markdown file. Run the generate script again and the JSON file will be updated. I use this same generate script to generate any markdown files that have a timestamp later than the corresponding JSON file. Speedy data load from JSON and built in content backup in case your Markdown content file gets fubar.\r\\n\r\\n   The concept was for all filepaths, latest blogs, and content to be generated locally. The only blocker was Vercel needed all build files to be fully static for that prebuild deploy. I use dynamic paths, etc. However, if I prebuild with timestamps, nothing is generated on Vercel, just checked. I did not like the results going full static so I let Vercel do the build and changed file check. Increased my build time, but still under free build limits. \r\\n\r\\n   Detail pages use a semi-aware media gallery. Determines tall or wide format and adds no thumbnail bar if only one image. Has inline image options that are external link aware. Feature tagged. Some title overrides if not empty.\r\\n\r\\n   Also I used markdown to rich html conversion in my JSON files. That gives my JSON files basic html flexiblity if I need it. Markdown alone can be a slow conversion to html, and JSON is too limiting for styled content. So now with content redundancy, I have best of both worlds.\r\\n\r\\n5. **Policy Pages:** Those are just no-frill content data pages. \r\\n\r\\n6. **Mobile:** Used the common small profile picture approach for mobile as text was too hard to read. Everything stacks, nothing new there. Tried to use fluid responsive and clamp when I remembered. \r\\n\r\\n## Project Structure\r\\n```html\r\\nsrc/\r\\n├── app/                    # Next.js App Router pages\r\\n│   ├── about/              # About page\r\\n│   ├── blog/               # Blog listing & [slug] pages  \r\\n│   ├── projects/           # Project showcase & [slug] pages\r\\n│   └── tools/              # Tools/stack page\r\\n├── components/             # Reusable UI components\r\\n│   ├── layout/             # Header, Footer, Navigation\r\\n│   └── ui/                 # Button, LoadingSpinner, etc.\r\\n├── lib/                    # Core utilities\r\\n│   ├── generated/          # Auto-generated content manifests\r\\n│   ├── types/              # TypeScript definitions\r\\n│   ├── blogLoader.ts       # Blog content system\r\\n│   └── projectLoader.ts    # Project content system\r\\n└── styles/                 # CSS files\r\\n```\r\\n\r\\n## New Project\r\\n1. Create folder: `src/app/projects/content/your-project/`\r\\n2. Add project web optimized images in root folder level\r\\n3. Run `npm run generate-project-data`\r\\n4. A `project.md` and `project.json` file will be created. Edit only md file.\r\\n5. After markdown file is edited, run `npm run generate-project-data`\r\\n\r\\n## Results\r\\n\r\\nThe portfolio rebuild achieved all tech and design goals. The dark iridescent glassmorphism look creates visual impact while addressing responsive across devices. The hybrid content management system provides the editing convenience of markdown with the performance benefits of JSON, making it workable on Vercel's free tier. \r\\n\r\\nKey wins include implementing Next.js 15 and React 19 within weeks of their release, creating a custom utility system when Tailwind compatibility failed, and developing an automated content generation workflow. The hover-activated portrait and animated orb system provides desktop impact without overwhelming mobile users.\r\\n\r\\nIt is newly released so I will add more content and bug fixes as time permits.\r\\n\r\\n\r\\n",

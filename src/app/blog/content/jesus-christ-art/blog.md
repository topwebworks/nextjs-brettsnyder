## My Digital Process

I used Photoshop as my canvas, locally generated AI elements, my sketches, and some stock as a base references. Then manually composite, restructure, and repaint. Then pass my draft through AI image to image refinement using local AI tools generated from my laptop. That output is the next round starting point to manually manipulate and repaint in Photoshop. 

Each manual round in Photoshop took several days, and crafting the image to image refinement would take a couple days. There is never direct AI output to final art as is common with online AI services. Every part of the final portrait is at usually around 30+ rounds, several weeks and months of manual evelolution in PhotoShop.

## Crown of Thorns

This sketch I did when I was 17, while preparing to go on a mission to Hong Kong. It symbolized His sacrifice for all of us. Strong neck. Bruised forehead. Blood into tears. Looking up. Resurrection. Each with a deeper meaning to me; find your own symbolism. And later a digital version called Crown of Thorns 2.

## Lord Looketh

After I returned from Hong Kong, I drew this version. How Christ knows us, each of us. These sketches are just a reminder to find your own relationship with Him. Only takes a small belief, darkness fades and great things will happen. I have had so many in my life. And later a digital version called Lord Looketh 2.

## Inspiration Library

I created the Inspiration Library using Nextjs as a safe blog for sharing my favorite short inspirational stories and thoughts. It began as an extension of the message on JesusChrist.art. I decided to keep them separate to avoid overwhelming visitors. I deliberately made it text-only, no images, for easy access on phones and easy copying.
